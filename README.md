# **üëÅÔ∏è Stock Sight**

This project is a full-stack web application designed to predict stock prices using a pre-trained machine learning model and provide AI-driven insights. It features a responsive front-end built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, communicating with a robust Flask backend that handles data fetching, feature engineering, model inference, and large language model (LLM) integration.

## **‚ú® Features**

* **Stock Price Prediction:** Predict future stock prices for various companies based on historical data using a LightGBM machine learning model.  
* **Intuitive Web Interface:** A clean and responsive user interface allows users to easily input company symbols and prediction dates.  
* **Flask API Backend:** A powerful Python Flask server serves as the backbone, managing data requests, model predictions, and interactions with external APIs.  
* **Real-time Data Integration:** Utilizes yfinance to fetch real-time and historical stock data.  
* **Technical Analysis (TA) Features:** Incorporates various technical indicators (SMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.) as features for enhanced prediction accuracy.  
* **AI Insights & Explanations:** Integrates with a Large Language Model (LLM) to provide insightful analysis and explanations for the stock predictions, enhancing user understanding.  
* **Modern Styling:** Features a visually appealing design with custom CSS, including gradients, animations, and Bootstrap for a consistent look and feel.

## **‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation**

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Stock-Sight.git  
   cd Stock-Sight

   *(Remember to replace your-username and Stock-Sight with your actual GitHub username and repository name.)*  
2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**  
   python \-m venv venv  
   source venv/bin/activate  \# On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate

3. **Install Python dependencies:**  
   pip install Flask Flask-Cors joblib pandas yfinance numpy ta

   *(Ensure roc\_model3.pkl is in the Backend directory.)*  
4. **Run the Flask backend:**  
   * Navigate into the Backend directory:  
     cd Backend

   * Run the Flask app:  
     python app.py

The Flask app will typically run on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ or http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

5. **Open the frontend:**  
   * Once the Flask server is running, open your web browser and go to the Flask server's address:  
     http://127.0.0.1:5000/

This will serve index.html from your Frontend folder.

## **üí° Usage**

1. Once the Flask server is running and the web page is open in your browser, you will see the "Stock Price Predictor" interface.  
2. Select a **Company Symbol** from the dropdown.  
3. Select a **Prediction Date**.  
4. Click the "Predict Stock Price" button to get the estimated price.  
5. Optionally, click "‚ú® Get Stock Insights" or "‚ú® Explain Prediction" to receive AI-generated information about the stock or the prediction itself.
